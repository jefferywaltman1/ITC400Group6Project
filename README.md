STEPS TO CONFIGURE OUR CODE/PROJECT

STEP 1:
To first initialize our project, in the github repository you will need to click the [green <> Code] drop down to copy the HTTPS link to our repository.You will then need to navigate to visual studio code, or an IDE of your choosing and open the source control panel option.

From there you will click the clone repository and add the HTTPS link you just copied from our github repository.

STEP 2:
After our code/repo is up and running in your IDE you will then need to install the following packages in the terminal.

Packages:
node.js,
express.js,
nodemon, and
sqlite


STEP 3: 
INSTALL NODE:
Here is a link on how to install node.js: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-node-run-npm-in-vs-code/
After node.js is installed to your machine, then navigate to the terminal and run this command:

npm install node.js

This goes the same for the rest of the packages. Navigate to the terminal and use these commands for the following packages:

STEP 4:
After all of these packages have been installed, you can then run the command in the terminal: nodemon {{File Location of Server.js}}.

This command will output some data to the terminal letting you know the server is running on port 3000. You will need to CTRL click the hyperlink and it will then take you to the website/project we developed. From there you should be able to watch our demo provided in the presentation to test out our game!
